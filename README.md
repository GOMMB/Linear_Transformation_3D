## Requirements

This requires <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a> in Python mode to run.

## Usage

* To run the animation, open Matrix_Transformations_3d.pyde with Processing and click run.
* To edit the matrix used for the transformation, open the matrix.txt file and put in the 3D matrix you want to be animated.

### Controls
  * **Left Click:** This compounds the transformation, equivalent to multiplying the matrix by itself.
  * **Right Click:** This resets/replays the animation as if you just started it. 
  * **Mouse Movement:** This rotates the 3D object.

## Extra info
* The blue plane is the X-Y plane.
* The yellow plane is the X-Z plane.
* The red plane is the Y-Z plane.
